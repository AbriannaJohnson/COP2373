# Program description:
# This program allows buyers to purchase a limited amount of
# tickets to a cinema, and displays the number of tickets
# remaining after each purchase



# Function 1: get_tickets_from_buyer()

# Description: This function creates a loop for the user to keep
# giving an input for the number of tickets they want to buy until
# all tickets have been sold. It also limits the user to 1 to 4 tickets,
# and makes the user enter a number as a value.

# Parameters: None

# Variables: num_tickets - holds the number of tickets the buyer wants

# Logical steps:
# 1. create a variable that holds the input from the buyer
# 2. if the input is between 1 and 4 it returns the number
# 3. if the input is not in that range, a message pops up and starts the loop again
# 4. if the input is not a number, a message pops up and restarts the loop

# Returns: num_tickets - returns a number that is within the requirements



# Function 2: sell_tickets()

# Description: This function keeps track of the number of tickets sold,
# subtracts it from the total until all tickets sell and the loop ends

# Parameters: None

# Variables:
# 1. total_tickets - a hardcoded number of tickets available from the start
# 2. tickets_left - keeps track of the tickets after a purchase
# 3. num_buyers - an accumulator for the number of purchases
# 4. tickets_wanted - calls the get_tickets_from_buyer() function to start
#                     the loop and creates a variable that can be subtracted from the total

# Logical steps:
# 1. Create a variable that holds the hardcoded number of tickets
# 2. Set the tickets left after a purchase to equal total tickets
# 3. Display the number to the user
# 4. Create a loop that restarts until all tickets are sold
# 5. create an instance of the get_tickets_from_buyer() function
# 6. Subtract tickets wanted from tickets available and add one to the number of buyers
# 7. Print messages that display the number of buyers and that all tickets have been sold.

# Returns: None
